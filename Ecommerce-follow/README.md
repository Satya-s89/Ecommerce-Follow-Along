   - Built a responsive and accessible sign-up form using **HTML**, **CSS (Tailwind)**, and **React**.
   - Added input fields for the following:
     - Name
     - Email
     - Password
   - Styled the form to ensure it is aesthetically pleasing and fits seamlessly with the app's theme.

2. **Form Validation**:
   - Implemented **client-side validation** to ensure users provide accurate and valid data before submission:
     - Ensured the Name field is not empty.
     - Validated Email format using regex.
     - Enforced a minimum password length of 8 characters for security purposes.
   - Provided real-time feedback for invalid inputs, improving the user experience.

3. **Backend Integration**:
   - Connected the frontend to the backend API for user registration using **Axios**:
     - Sent the user’s Name, Email, and Password to the backend server for processing.
     - Handled success and error responses gracefully with meaningful feedback.

# **Ecommerce-Follow-Along**

## **Milestone 7: User Login Authentication** 🔑

### **Overview**
In this milestone, the focus was on implementing a backend endpoint for user login. The core functionality centered around validating user credentials and securely comparing encrypted passwords using `bcrypt`. This milestone helps ensure secure authentication for users while adhering to industry-standard practices.

---

### **What Was Achieved**
1. **Login Endpoint Implementation**:
   - Created a `POST /login` endpoint to accept user credentials (email/username and password).
   - Validated if the provided credentials match an existing user in the database.

2. **Password Encryption and Validation**:
   - Used `bcrypt` to securely hash passwords during user registration.
   - During login, compared the hashed password stored in the database with the hashed version of the user's input.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Returned meaningful error messages:
     - *"User does not exist"* if the email/username was not found.
     - *"Incorrect password"* if the password comparison failed.

4. **Secure Practices**:
   - No sensitive data was stored in plain text.
   - Only the password hash was stored in the database.
   - Followed one-way password hashing techniques to prevent password theft.

---

### **How Login Authentication Works**
1. **User Input Validation**:
   - The user enters their email/username and password.
   - Input is validated for completeness (e.g., non-empty fields).

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - The backend fetches the corresponding user record from the database using the provided email/username.

3. **Password Comparison**:
   - The input password is hashed using `bcrypt` and compared to the stored hash.

4. **Authentication**:
   - If the hashes match, the user is successfully authenticated.
   - If the hashes don’t match, the user receives an error message.

---

### **Technologies Used**
- **Node.js**: Backend framework.
- **Express.js**: Framework for creating RESTful APIs.
- **bcrypt**: For secure password hashing and comparison.
